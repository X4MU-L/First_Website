# My First Web Site.

This project is just a pet portfolio site built using [REACT JS](https://reactjs.org/) as part of my learning process to test my basic knowledge in [REACT JS](https://reactjs.org/), the project is currently hosted [HERE](https://samuelcode.netlify.app/) on Netlify (a free hosting plathform). 
This Project does not have a database **as of yet**, but uses a third-party library [EMAILJS](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/) to recieve emails from contacts.

## The Frontend

The frondend uses a react and currently contains 3 endpoints:
- About `/`
  - The about page/endpoint is homepage/about page of the site with minimal information about the page and a call to action
- Contacts `/contact`
  - The contacts page/endpoint is just a contact page where users can send mails with their email address and prefered name, this page also uses basic validation and regex expressions to validate email address as well as required inputs.
- Portfolio `/portfolio`
  - This page is meant to contain projects executed or being worked on... currently empty :sob:
  
 The page is responsive across all devices.
 
 
 ## The Backend - coming soon

 This project currently does not have a frontend.... :disappointed_relieved:
 
 ## Going Forward
 
 This project was born out a drive to test a basic learning, it is planned to evolve and add more functionalies and a backend as i am currently Learning more towards that goal.
Will appreciate any suggestion or Ideas as well, can always reach me on [here](mailto:okolisamuel21@gmail.com), will also be glad to recieve mails on areas I have implemented badly.
